Templates
By default you create a bare workflow React project with support for iOS, Android, and web. The project comes preconfigured with support for Expo Modules, an API writing native modules using Swift and Kotlin, and this also makes it possible to use any library in the Expo SDK.

You can opt to use an example project instead by selecting the "Templates from ..." option. Custom templates can be used with --template <Example Name or GitHub URL> option.

Use an example: npx create-react-native-app -t with-typescript
Use a custom template: npx create-react-native-app --template https://github.com/someone/my-react-starter -- Only works with GitHub repos on the master branch.
All examples can be modified in the expo/examples repo.
